## Notes

### Github Pages 404 errors

When first published this site threw 404 errors when it tried to load the wasm bundles and css files.
This is because github pages sees "*load /styles.css*" and tries to load them from `https://brstrutt.github.io/styles.css`.
Obviously this fails because the styles are ACTUALLY at `https://brstrutt.github.io/IsWorcesterUnderwaterV2/styles.css`.
Looks like one solution is to remove the opening `/` from the filepaths....but how can I get trunk to do that?
The solution seems to be to create a `Trunk.toml` file containing the following:
```toml
[build]
public_url = "/IsWorcesterUnderwaterV2/"
```
Now my release build has the specified `public_url` prefixed onto all the 404-ing links.
Do be aware this means that running `trunk serve` will host the site at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/IsWorcesterUnderwaterV2`, which means the "open this page in the browser" popup will point at a 404 page.

### The wave animation

#### Previous implementation

The old site made the waves effect using pure CSS. Pretty cool, but kinda hard to understand.
Basically, it followed [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf6qm5JMUXQ). Do something like this:

```css
.insideTheWave {
    animation: waveKeyframes 10s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes waveKeyframes {
    0% {
        clip-path: polygon(
            0% 100%,
            var(--Keyframe0),
            100% 100% );
    }
    50% {
        clip-path: polygon(
            0% 100%,
            var(--Keyframe1),
            100% 100% );
    }
    100% {
        clip-path: polygon(
            0% 100%,
            var(--Keyframe0),
            100% 100% );
    }
}
```

In the above the `--Keyframe0` and `--Keyframe1` variables are generated by PHP and injected into the page as a separate css file.

#### New implementation

Now I need to do something similar in Rust, but without it being the unreadable mess that this PHP implementation kinda ended up being.
I can't just inject css keyframe variables like I did with PHP, so I'm thinking use inline styles for this. Kinda unpleasant but might be easier to work with.

Ok it looks like you can't inline the @keyframe declaration. Bummer.
But you CAN inline the css variables! Ok new plan: do that.
