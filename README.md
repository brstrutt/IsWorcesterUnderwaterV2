# IsWorcesterUnderwaterV2

A rewrite of IsWorcesterUnderwater.co.uk to be a static site built using Rust and Yew. Intended to replace the old PHP/HTML/CSS implementation.

## Development

This project uses a vscode devcontainer. I recommend you use it.

To build the project and host it locally, run `trunk serve`

## Tools

`devcontainer`: docker based development environment with lots of vscode integration.
`Rust`: programming language
`Cargo`: standard tool for working with `Rust`. Used for building/test/managing dependencies
`Yew`: Frontend library for developing webapps in `Rust`. Think `React` but for `Rust`
`Trunk`: Tool to make developing webapps much easier in `Rust`. Use this instead of `Cargo` for building/running the project.
